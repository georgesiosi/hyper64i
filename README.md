A revolutionary fusion of ancient Chinese philosophy (I-Ching) and modern complexity theory, implementing Williams' ‚àöt space-time simulation theorem on a 6-dimensional hypercube where each vertex corresponds to an I-Ching hexagram.

## ‚ú® What Makes This Special

This isn't just another data structure visualization. It's a **breakthrough intersection** of:

- **üìä Complexity Theory**: Williams' ‚àöt space-time simulation
- **üîó Graph Algorithms**: Hypercube traversal and Gray code sequences  
- **‚òØÔ∏è Ancient Wisdom**: 6,000-year-old I-Ching hexagram system
- **üß† Memory Management**: Optimal locality with semantic debugging context

**The key insight**: Adjacent hexagrams differ by exactly one line, which maps perfectly to Hamming-1 transitions in the hypercube, ensuring optimal memory locality while providing meaningful symbolic context.

## üéØ Core Concept

The **64-Cell Hyper-Stack Memory Scheduler** maps computational memory operations onto a 6-dimensional hypercube where:

- Each of 64 vertices = I-Ching hexagram = Memory cell
- Binary state: `0` (yin ‚öã) / `1` (yang ‚öä) 
- Gray code traversal = Optimal memory transitions
- Symbolic meaning aids debugging and visualization

### Performance Targets
- **1-D Stencil**: ‚â§ 0.6‚àöt cells (~1900 states for t=10‚Åµ) with ‚â§4√ó slowdown
- **Binary Tree**: ‚â§ 1024 states via subtree symmetry with ‚â§2√ó slowdown  
- **Transformer**: 64 chunk states mapped to 64 cube cells with ‚â§1.5√ó slowdown

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

### Interactive Visualization
- **6D Hypercube Display**: Circular 2D projection with 64 nodes
- **I-Ching Grid**: 8√ó8 grid with traditional hexagram line representations
- **Real-time Animation**: Gray code path visualization
- **Click Navigation**: Jump directly to any memory cell/hexagram

### Simulation Engine
